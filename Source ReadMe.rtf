\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 Xcode Project
\f1\b0 \
CiphSafe is developed using Xcode, hence it's necessary if you want to look at the overall project.  The source files are just source files, so they can be read with any text editor.\
\

\f0\b Source Files
\f1\b0 \
The source is made up of the following files:\
\
BLBTableView.[hm] - A customized NSTableView subclass to add custom-color striping, and some additional delegations.\
\
CSAppController.[hm] - The application controller (the delegate for NSApp).  Handles some initialization tasks, implements close all, and arranges the Window menu.\
\
CSDocModel.[hm] - The model portion for CiphSafe in the MVC style; handles all the low-level stuff regarding entries, including encryption.\
\
CSDocument.[hm] - The NSDocument subclass, and a model-controller in MVC.\
\
CSPrefsController.[hm] - An NSWindowController subclass managing the preferences window.\
\
CSWinCtrlAdd.[hm] - A CSWinCtrlEntry subclass whose purpose is to handle 'add new entry' windows.\
\
CSWinCtrlChange.[hm] - A CSWinCtrlEntry subclass whose purpose is to handle viewing and changing windows.\
\
CSWinCtrlEntry.[hm] - An NSWindowController subclass that handles windows for adding, viewing, or changing entries; this is the superclass for the add and change classes as it handles several bits common to both.\
