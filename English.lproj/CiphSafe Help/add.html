<p>
The Add window is quite simple, accepting text input for each field, and a
button to generate a random password for you, if needed.  As this is used
only for for adding new entries, there is only one per document.

<p>
The Notes field is a full text editor (like TextEdit) where you can set
font attributes, colors, and so on.  The Format menu comes in handy here.
