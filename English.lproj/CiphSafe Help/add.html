<h1>CiphSafe Add Window Help</h1>
<p>
The Add window is quite simple, accepting text input for each field, and a
button to generate a random password for you, if needed.  As this is used
only for adding new entries, there is only one per document.  Select
a category either by choosing it from the drop-down list, or if the
category isn't listed, simply typing it into the input field.

<p>
The Notes field is a full text editor (like TextEdit) where you can set
font attributes, colors, and so on.  The Format menu comes in handy here.
