<h1>CiphSafe Document Window Help</h1>
<p>
By default, when you first open CiphSafe, it will create a new document
(like TextEdit, but this can be disabled, see
<a href="prefs.html">Preferences</a>).  The main document window is quite
simple, providing a table which lists all the entries in the document,
a few buttons, and search controls.

<h2>The Table</h2>
<p>
Entries can be sorted by any of the columns displayed on the main window by
simply clicking on the column header; clicking it again changes the
sort direction.  Control- (or right-) clicking on an entry will bring
up a menu with which you can copy any of the fields of that entry to
the clipboard or open the URL for that entry.  Double-clicking an entry
will open it in the view/change window, where you can view or change any
of the fields (selecting any entries and pressing the View button will do
the same).

<h2>Show and Hide Columns</h2>
<p>
Selecting which columns to show is simply a matter of control- (or right-)
clicking on the header for the table view, and selecting a column to
show or hide.  Selecting All shows all possible columns (selecting it
again does not hide them all).  At least one column must always be
visible, otherwise what is the point?
<p>
If you have potentially sensitive information in the notes field, you can
either hide the column outright, or place that information on the second
(or subsequent) line in the notes.  Only the text from the first line (text
prior to hitting the return key) appears in the main display.

<h2>Deleting Entries</h2>
<p>
Deleting entries is as simple as selecting which to delete, and pressing
the Delete button (or the delete key on your keyboard).  If the
<a href="prefs.html">preference</a> for confirming deletions is enabled,
a sheet will verify before actually deleting.  Deletes can also be
undone.

<h2>Searching</h2>
<p>
At the top of the window is a pull-down menu and a rounded text field
(initially says "search" in gray) which make finding entries easy.
First, select the field in which to search from the pull-down menu (initially
set to search the Name field).  Then, type in as many characters as needed to
limit your view of the document to entries which match that string in the
given field.  Erasing all characters or pressing the Reset button next to the
field will return to the full view of the document.  When the view is
filtered through the search control, the status field (which tells you how
many entries are in your document and how many are selected) will also say
"(filtered)" to let you know you're not seeing everything at the moment.

<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>
New in 1.2 is an additional field for an entry's category.  By default,
there are a few categories from which to choose: Banking, Forum, General,
Other Web, and Retail (these can be removed so only your categories
appear, see <a href="prefs.html">Preferences</a>).  New categories can be
added simply by typing in the category's name when needed (in the
<a href="add.html">Add Window</a>, the
<a href="change.html">Change Window</a>, or when using the
Edit->Set Category menu option, described below).  Categories you enter
stay with that particular document only, unless you specifically enter it
into another document. They are not saved in the application preferences
in case a specific category itself may be sensitive.  Once a new category
has been entered into an entry, that choice becomes available in the lists
for easy selection.
<p>
Since the category field is a new option with 1.2, an easy method for
setting the category on a number of entries at once should be very
useful.  This functionality can be found under the Edit menu, by
selecting the entries to update, then going to Edit->Set Category then
the category name.  Selecting New Category allows you to define a new
one (after which it should appear on all lists as long as it continues to
be used in that document).
