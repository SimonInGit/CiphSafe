<p>
By default, when you first open CiphSafe, it will create a new document
(like TextEdit, but this can be disabled, see
<a href="prefs.html">Preferences</a>).  The main document window is quite
simple, providing a table which lists all the entries in the document,
and just a few buttons.

<p>
Entries can be sorted by Name, Account, or URL by
simply clicking on the column header; clicking it again changes the
sort direction.  Control- (or right-) clicking on an entry will bring
up a menu with which you can copy any of the fields of that entry to
the pasteboard.  Double-clicking an entry will open it in the
view/change window, where you can view or change any of the fields
(selecting any entries and pressing the View button will do the same).

<p>
Deleting entries is as simple as selecting which to delete, and pressing
the Delete button (or the delete key on your keyboard).  If the
<a href="prefs.html">preference</a> for confirming deletions is enabled,
a sheet will verify before actually deleting.  Deletes can also be
undone.
