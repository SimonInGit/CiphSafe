<h1>CiphSafe Loading, Saving, and Changing the Passphrase</h1>
<h2>Loading</h2>
<p>
Loading an existing document will cause an 'Enter Passphrase' window,
in which (obviously) you enter the passphrase for that document.  If
the passphrase doesn't work, the window will return, giving another
opportunity.  You may continue this until you enter the correct
passphrase or hit the cancel button.  If the passphrase has been
forgotten, all data in the document is lost.

<h2>Saving</h2>
<p>
The first time a document is saved, a sheet will attach to the document's
window asking first for the name of the new document.  After it is
named, a new sheet will appear asking for the passphrase used to
protect the document.  There are two fields in which to enter the
passphrase, to make sure you've entered the correct phrase.  Choosing a
passphrase is important as a short, simple one (eg, "my passphrase")
makes for weak protection, and a long complicated one (eg, "seven spry
dobermans ran across the rickety old bridge after midnight") is quite
safe (except for that specific example now that it's been documented).

<h2>Changing the passphrase</h2>
<p>
Anytime after a document has been saved you can change the passphrase
protecting it (via File->Change Passphrase).  Just like saving, it
requires you to enter it twice to confirm.  Once the passphrase is
changed, the document will be saved immediately with the new phrase.
