<p>
CiphSafe provides an easy-to-use method for storing account/password pairs
as well as any general notes you wish to keep safe.  Each CiphSafe document
contains any number of entries, each of which has a name, account name,
password, associated URL, and notes field.  You can have multiple documents
to make categorizing or sharing simple, if needed.  Each document is
protected by its own passphrase, with the entire set of entries being
encrypted prior to being written to disk.
