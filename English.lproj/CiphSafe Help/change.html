<h1>CiphSafe View/Change Window Help</h1>
<p>
The View/Change window has the same basic layout as the
<a href="add.html">Add Window</a>, allowing you to see all fields including
the whole of the notes field.
<p>
Changing the entry in this window does not change it in the document until
the Change button is pressed; making a change and closing the window without
saving it will cause a warning sheet to this effect.  The URL for the entry
can also be opened in the proper application from this window.
