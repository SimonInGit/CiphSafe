<p>
Several behaviors are customizable in CiphSafe.  These are broken down into
three areas: <a href="#interface">Interface</a>,
<a href="#generation">Generating Passwords</a>, and
<a href="#misc">Miscellaneous</a>.

<h1><a name="interface">Interface Preferences</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt>Close add window after adding an entry</dt>
<dd>When adding a number of entries at once, disabling this option will make
life drastically easier.  The add window will stay open, and focused, after
an entry is added.  If enabled, adding an entry will cause the add window
to close.
</dd>

<dt>Close edit window after modifying an entry</dt>
<dd>Like the equivalent for the add window above, enabling this option
causes the view/change window to close after an entry has been modified.
</dd>

<dt>Confirm entry deletion</dt>
<dd>Asks, "Are you sure?" prior to deleting any entries, when enabled.
</dd>

<dt>Warn about a short passphrase</dt>
<dd>If checked, will warn when initially selecting a passphrase (or when
changing it) when that passphrase is short (less than eight characters).
</dd>

<dt>Create new document on activate</dt>
<dd>If on, initially starting CiphSafe, as well as clicking its icon in
the Dock when it has no open documents, will cause it to create a new
document (like TextEdit does).  If you find this annoying, turn it off.
</dd>

<dt>Include password on copy/drag to other apps</dt>
<dd>When enabled, a cut, copy, or drag of any entries will include the
password if the destination is an app other than CiphSafe.  In the disabled
state, all fields except for the password are available to the other
application.  When a cut, copy, or drag has a destination inside CiphSafe,
the password is always copied.
</dd>
</dl>

<h1><a name="generation">Generated Passwords</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt>Password length</dt>
<dd>Specify the length for passwords generated by CiphSafe (any value between
1 and 255 is acceptable).
</dd>

<dt>Use only alphanumerics</dt>
<dd>Will use only letters and numbers (a-z, A-Z, and 0-9) when checked,
otherwise will use a broader set of characters from the ASCII set.
</dd>
</dl>

<h1><a name="misc">Miscellaneous</a></h1>
<dl>
<dt>Keep backup copy</dt>
<dd>If on, when a document is saved, the previous version of the document
will be kept with a ~ (tilde) appended to the name, prior to the
extension (eg, document.csd will have document~.csd as the backup name).
</dd>

<dt>Clear clipboard on Quit</dt>
<dd>Clears the clipboard when CiphSafe quits, if CiphSafe was the last to
cut/copy something there.
</dd>
</dl>
