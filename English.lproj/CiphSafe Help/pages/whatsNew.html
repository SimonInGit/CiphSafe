      <h1>What's New in CiphSafe 1.3</h1>
   </div>
   <p>
      Several by-popular-request items have been added to CiphSafe for 1.3.
   </p>

   <table class="dots" width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"

            <p>
               The ability to export comma-separated value (CSV) and XML files
               has been added.  Now you can get data out of CiphSafe whenever
               needed.

               Prior versions only did a copy when dragging entries.  Now,
               per the Mac OS standard key combination of Command to move or
               Option to copy, entries can be moved or copied as needed.  Note
               that moving only works between CiphSafe documents, you can
               only copy to other applications.

            <p>
               The way preferences are handled has been heavily revamped:
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     The obvious change is the move to a more new-style
                     Preferences window (ala the
                     <a href="http://indiehig.com/wiki/Preferences_Windows">IndieHIG</a>)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     The window no longer uses Cancel/Save as it all now
                     updates in realtime
                  </li>

            <p>
               The main view of entries has had the alternating color option
               for some time, but 1.3 now allows the alternate color to be
               changed in case the standard light blue is too boring.  (Yes,
               bright red is really ugly for this.)

            <ul>
               <li>
                  Searching&mdash;With Mac OS X 10.3, the rounded search field became
                  available to non-Apple developers; hence CiphSafe now uses
                  one instead of the uglier set of pop-up menu, rounded text
                  field, and reset button.  The option of searching all
                  fields is now also available.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Help&mdash;CiphSafe's help has been moved to the
                  task-based style popular with Apple's apps, as well as vastly expanded.
                  Thanks to <a href="http://www.andymatuschak.org/pages/helptoolkit">
                  Andy Matuschak</a> for the documentation and toolkit.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Main window&mdash;the spacebar, when the main table has
                  focus, now pages down.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Links&mdash;Point things to <a href="http://sourceforge.net">
                  SourceForge</a> instead of withay.com.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Preferences&mdash;The "warn on short passphrase" has been
                  removed, CiphSafe will now always warn when it's short.
               </li>
               <li>
                  File Saving&mdash;Older version of CiphSafe didn't do anything
                  with the saved file's permission, which resulted in them being
                  readable to anyone else on the computer.  Version 1.3 now makes sure
                  they are saved as readable only to the owner.
               </li>
               <li>
                  File Opening&mdash;Previously, if you had an auto-open document
                  selected and started CiphSafe by either double-clicking or dragging
                  a document, CiphSafe would open that as well as the auto-open
                  document.  Now, the auto-open is not opened when another document is requested.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Entry Contextual Menu&mdash;The contextual menu (via right- or Ctrl-clicking)
                  for entries now disables any options for fields which are not present in the
                  given entry.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Quitting&mdash;An issue where having changes in a change window then quitting
                  CiphSafe would not warn about unsaved changes has been fixed.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Performance&mdash;Performance for really large documents containing complicated
                  notes fields has been improved.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Code&mdash;Not something the average user will see, but a number
                  of changes at the source level have been made to improve
                  things.
               </li>
