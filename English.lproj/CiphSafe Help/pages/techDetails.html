   <p>
      CiphSafe saves each document using the
      <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/bfsverlag.html">Blowfish</a> cipher,
      using a 320 bit key, in cipher block chaining mode.
   </p>
   <p>
      The key is created by splitting the passphrase into two halves, then calculating
      the SHA-1 hash for each half.  Since SHA-1 generates a 160 bit result, this is
      where the 320 bit keysize originates.
   </p>
   <p>
      Both the Blowfish and SHA-1 algorithms are not actually in the application,
      however, as CiphSafe uses the <a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a>
      library (shipped with Mac OS X) to perform this work.
   </p>
   <p>
      Since CiphSafe uses cipher block chaining, it requires an initialization
      vector (IV).  The IV is simply eight random bytes, grabbed from the
      /dev/random device.  It is then saved as the first part of the resulting file.
   </p>
   <p>
      The data saved to disk is first passed to Cocoa's NSArchiver to generate a
      bunch of bytes from all the entries in the document.  These bytes are then
      compressed with <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</a>, and finally
      encrypted using the key and the random IV.  This causes each save to be quite
      different from the previous, even if no entries have been changed, as a new
      IV is created.
