      If you have a regular backup regimen (and you should), you'll probably want to
      know where CiphSafe stores various files so they can be included.  By default,
      CiphSafe is a good Mac citizen and stores any files you save into your Documents
      folder, so if your home folder is included in backups, CiphSafe documents should
      already be covered.  The files are saved with a "csd" extension, so should be easy
      to spot.

      Preferences are like other Mac applications where they are stored in the Preferences
      folder of the Library folder in your home directory.  If you look, there should be
      a bunch of files with a "plist" extension, one of them being
      "com.withay.ciphsafe.plist".  This stores anything you've changed in the Preferences
      window, as well as other bits such as window size and locations, table column
      arrangement, etc.
